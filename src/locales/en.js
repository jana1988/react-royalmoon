However, playing for money bears the risk of gambling becoming problematic as a person becomes unable to control how much time and money he/she spends on gambling. Here at RoyalMoon, we encourage our customers, while having fun, not to allow their gambling to affect their usual daily routine or time spent with family and friends. Making sure that the money they spend is set aside for leisure time and not for other purposes.

  TERMS_CONDITIONS_5_TEXT: `KYC / AML Policies
  Bridge Technologies B.V. is committed to the highest standards of compliance against money laundering (AML) and anti-terrorist financing (CTF). The objective of the Companies Policy against Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing is to actively prevent the risks of these matters.

  • Placement. At this stage, the funds are turned into financial instruments, such as checks, bank accounts, and money transfers, or they can be used to buy high-value goods that can be resold. They can also be physically deposited in banks and non-bank institutions (eg exchange houses). To avoid suspicion on the part of the company, the bleach can also make several deposits instead of depositing the entire sum at once, this form of placement is called smurf.
  • Layers. The funds are transferred or moved to other accounts and other financial instruments. It is done to disguise the origin and interrupt the indication of the entity that carried out the multiple financial transactions. Moving funds and changing their form makes it difficult to track the money that is being laundered.
